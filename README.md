## 🎮 Time Slot Rules
- Each **30-minute slot** can only have **ONE player** per ministry
- Example: If Player1 takes `00:00-00:30` for Construction, no one else can take that slot for Construction
- But Player2 CAN take `00:00-00:30` for Research (different ministry)
- Plan accordingly to avoid conflicts!
